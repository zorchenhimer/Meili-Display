# Meili - Display Console
The display console is the non-interactive information terminal component of
the Meili Arrival and Departure system.  This is the original component that
grew into what is now Meili.

This code was originally written to work with an in-house system, but was
written with portability in mind.  All of the in-house specific code has been
removed.  Once the server component of Meili is in a more complete state work
will begin on polishing the display console.
